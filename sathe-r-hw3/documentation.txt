Name: Reva Sathe
Class: IGME 330 Section 03


Audio Effects: The two audio effects I added to my visualizer were a treble booster and a bass booster that can be toggled via checkboxes on the side control panel.

Sprite Classes: 
Both of these classes utilize audioData's length.
    1. Phyllo - draws a cluster of shapes similar to a Phyllotaxis that grows, shrinks, and populates according to the notes currently being played and the point you are at in a song.
    2. Shapes - draws a square that grows and pulsates based upon the point you are at in the song as well as the notes of the song.

av-data.js: Stores the title of the application, the array of songs you can play, and the instructions and warnings for opperating the visualizer.

Visual Improvements: I changed the colors so that they were less garrish and made a few different themes that the user can use that fit different times of day.
