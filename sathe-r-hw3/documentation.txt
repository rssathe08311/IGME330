Name: Reva Sathe
Class: IGME 330 Section 03

Homework 2 Changes:
Audio Effects: The two audio effects I added to my visualizer were a treble booster and a bass booster that can be toggled via checkboxes on the side control panel.

Sprite Classes: 
Both of these classes utilize audioData's length.
    1. Phyllo - draws a cluster of shapes similar to a Phyllotaxis that grows, shrinks, and populates according to the notes currently being played and the point you are at in a song.
    2. Shapes - draws a square that grows and pulsates based upon the point you are at in the song as well as the notes of the song.

av-data.js: Stores the title of the application, the array of songs you can play, and the instructions and warnings for opperating the visualizer.

Visual Improvements: I changed the colors so that they were less garrish and made a few different themes that the user can use that fit different times of day. 

Homework 3 Changes:
Language: Typescript
    - I changed all of my old javascript classes to be Typescript classes. I first set up Typescript and Webpack tooling. Then I resolved Typescript errors such as import and export changes, 
        type assignment, strong assignment of variables, organizing enums and interfaces into different files, and the restructuring of sprite classes. Then finally I organized the src folder. 
        Then I bundled the project into bundle.js based upon the typescript transpiling instructions.
