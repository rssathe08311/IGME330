    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I used the spotify API accessing it through the client credentials method that makes it so that the user does not have to log into their spotify account in order to use the site. 
        It allows users to discover songs through looking through spotify generated playlists depending on genre. Some playlists are ordered by ranking specifically any of them labeled "top" which allows the user to see the rankings of songs based upon the week. 
        The intended audience is people interested in music charts and users of Spotify or other similar music streaming services. 
        It includes a textbox that the user can enter in the number of results they want, a genre drop down, and a playlist dropdown to select what playlist the user wants to look through. 
        The user is then able to look through the songs and veiw the name, artists on the song, and the album/song cover of the song.
    </p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Initially getting started with the spotify API was fairly tricky as accessing it is fairly different than accessing other APIs due to the amount of verification and authorization needed to access it.
        Though through following Avery Wicks's tutorial I was able to figure it out and created the base of what the website eventually became. Once the base of the website was built I continued by adding in the
         textbox for the number of results, made the song result stick with the user, local storace features, and due to the fact that the tutorial used bootstrap for its design I spent a significant amount of time
          reworking it in plain css, while also stylistically changing aspects so they looked like what I wanted.
