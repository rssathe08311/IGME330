If the presets do not satisfy you you can play around with specific visualizations with the checkboxes under specific controls. You can also alter the audio through the Treble, Bass and Volume controls to your liking. Certain combinations will make the screen hard to look at so if you are sensative to visuals stay away from the noise and emboss controls."
